# CIF2LADY
Program for automatic data conversion from Crystallographic Information File (CIF) format to LADY-input(.inp) format(https://sourceforge.net/projects/ladytool/) 
Database(DB) file contains some force constants for semi-empirical lattice dynamics calculations using LADY programm. Throught this app you can modify this file by adding your own values as bond constants of any chemical elements pairs. 

Example of usage:
1. Choose cif-file using the topmost one button.
2. Optional: checkbox let programm automatically write potential part in inp-file if there is information about atoms from CIF-file in app's database(DB).
3. Press second from the top button. Choose path where you want to have converted inp-file for LADY programm.
4. CONGRATS!
5. In the latest version you can modify DB-file. Press the third from the top button: 
   a)
